# COMPANYXPTO Recruitment Coding Test

## Context
At COMPANYXPTO, we found that the company’s growth of consultants is equivalent to the Fibonacci sequence numbers.
Each position of the sequence values directly corresponds to the years of existence of the company and each odd number directly corresponds to the number of employees in that year.
Because of the prices of the buildings in Portugal we need to make several simulations so we can understand in advance when we must rethink our office planning, so we can maintain the quality of our offices. We’ll do that every time a prime number is in the sequence.
We need to do several simulations, so we need to have some unpredictability.

## Main Goal
Read and interpret the information carefully and build the best solution to help us gather this information.
Feel free to add whatever you think is useful.

## Requirements
- Build one or more functions that generate a random number for an interval given by the user.
- Build one or more functions that generate the Fibonacci sequence from 0 to a given value range.
    - Use the value generated in the previous point.
- Build one or more functions that calculate the number of prime and odd numbers in each set of values.
    - Use the Fibonacci sequence generated in the previous point.

## Rules
- You have 24 hours to execute this task and deliver it via email.
- Develop the solution in a programming language you feel comfortable with (Java is a plus).
- If you can't finish all the steps, please still send us your solution.
